# Leetcode Simplified – DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my curated collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems, solved using **C++**.  
This repository is structured topic-wise and aims to reflect clarity in thought, clean code, and strong fundamentals.

## Folder Structure

Each folder contains problems related to that topic:

- `Linked_Lists/` – Singly, doubly, cycle detection, sorting, addition etc.
- `Trees/` – Binary trees, traversals, tree views, construction, standard BFS problems, Morris Traversal etc.
- `Graphs/` – BFS, DFS, topological sort, shortest path algorithms, cycles etc.
- `DSU/` – Union-Find, path compression, Kruskal’s algorithm, etc.
- (More coming soon…)

Each file typically includes:
- Problem approach
- Code with clean formatting
- Comments where needed for clarity
